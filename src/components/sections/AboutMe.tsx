        I think life is meaningful when I create. And that's why I became a full
        stack developer. I started programming in high school, creating simple
        programs and games in python. I've always had an eye for the smallest
        details, so I embarked on a career as a front end developer while in
        college. In doing so, I often handled back end and dev ops as well, so
        experience there is definitely not lacking.

        In my spare time I like to code (how surprising ðŸ˜„) but outside of that
        I like to paint, play board games and workout.
